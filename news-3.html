    <br>A gunman shot dead three black people at a store in Florida, United States. The shooting incident caused a stir because it was based on racist motives. Some of people who had witnessed the incident said that the gunman targeted a specific group of people and all of them was all black people. A sheriff told that he said he wanted to kill them and he said it clearly. The gunman is thought to  be an early 20 year old, but his identity is not yet to be known. The sheriff also said that the guy entered the dollar store, wearing a tactical vest, and brought a rifle gun.
