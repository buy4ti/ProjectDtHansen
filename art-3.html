    <br>An abstract art made by Jaison Cianelli that attracts our eyes with warming colors. Light and shadows that create waves and made it seem real like we are enjoying a sunset. Somehow the texture of the art that Jaison painted make the waves looks like its moving forward and backward.
    </div>

    <div class="Paragraph01">
    <br>Jaison wanted to shatre her love for nature by expressing her feelings into the painting and also spotlighting some aspect to the art. She was also inspired by a beautiful sunset that she wanted to share what Jaison ejoys the wonderful effect to people.
